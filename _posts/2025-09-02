<h3><a href="https://thediagram.com/25_2/landman.html">Appeal by Seth Landman</a></h3>
Distance and apprehension and the kind of enjoying the world that leaves grass rash. Or blisters. Not a lot to say about a good poem that the poem doesn’t say.

<h3><a href="https://www.hobartpulp.com/web_features/breaking-character">Breaking Character by Marie López</a></h3>
Right amount of propulsive curiosity kept me going. Good idea and decent exploration for the length. I’d read a longer and slower expansion. 

<h3><a href="https://www.ergot.press/authors/Akis_Linardos/Another_Brick_That_Wouldn't_Melt">Another Brick That Wouldn't Melt by Akis Linardos</a></h3>
Students connected with bricks that refract their boundedness to a school. The aspects in the story that raise productive confusions keep getting swept into safe/certain ideas, but then reemerge and recycle. It’s a nice way of making rhythm.
