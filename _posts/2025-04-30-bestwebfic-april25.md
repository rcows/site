<h3><a href="https://wigleaf.com/202504flood.htm">Before the Flood</a> by Sam Schieren</h3>
Bumming around with a dog and trying to find work and love and anticipating doom as fear and desire. It’s a warm and dusty little story that feels true in the right ways. I’m glad I finally figured out that you can find permalinks to Wigleaf stories. I was confused for a long time. This one does the short sentence work well. It carries you along. “The faint milky band of our galaxy looms. I find its clear definition disturbing, as if it were a frightening place I might have to visit soon and unexpectedly.” I feel that. I miss smoking and it’s okay for smoking to be in stories. I got 3 teeth removed this week and can’t inhale anything like that because I don’t want dry sockets. (I got them last time I had 2 teeth out by smoking.) What’s a secret? What’s private? Why? I think probably everything and then nothing.

<h3><a href="https://www.havehashad.com/hadposts/fishbone-crown-bleeding-eyes">Fishbone Crown, Bleeding Eyes</a> by Laila Amado</h3>
Structure in shorter stories is hard and this one nails it. Paragraph units with multiple choice subunits that really pop. Another flood, maybe something I’m drawn toward. The multiple choice elements layer what at first feel like potentialities, but then feel like parallel realities, and parallel realities held by one mind. Works with childhood and motherhood in tangled ways that feel human, feel the multiplicities of identity and experience. And in the chaos this one is brought onto the life raft. This one is lucky among what. Yeah, the more I think about this one the more I like it.

<h3><a href="https://farewelltransmission.net/2025/04/lemonade-stand/">Lemonade Stand</a> by David Luntz</h3>
A guy steals lemonade from children and, to try and justify his theft, delivers a screed about markets and labor. As this isolated tension gets hurled at these children, the guy tries forcing the children to flee. The sentences start jittery and then extend in ways I like. Nice balance of intensity and humor. Part of what people like about stories is how they tap personal memories and shake them up. The only time I had a lemonade stand as a kid was also the first time I noticed rap outside my home. Two guys in a tinted Cadillac bought two cups ($2 total) and tipped me $20. I couldn’t really hear what they said over the music. They might be the most generous people I've ever met. Instead of tipping, Luntz's narrator does what most of us do: uses elaborate framing to justify his actions and even makes himself feel good that he’s teaching them a lesson about the truth of that framing. This spotlights our decay.
