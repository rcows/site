<h3>Lemonade Stand by David Luntz</h3>
A guy steals lemonade from children and, to try and justify his theft, delivers a screed about markets and labor. As this isolated tension gets hurled at these children, the guy tries forcing the children to flee. The sentences start jittery and then extend in ways I like. Nice balance of intensity and humor.  I spent the first paragraph considering stopping but then grew to like the energy. Part of what people like about stories is how they tap personal memories and shake them up. The only time I had a lemonade stand as a kid was also the first time I noticed rap outside my home. Two guys in a tinted Cadillac bought two cups ($2 total) and tipped me $20. I couldn’t really hear what they said over the music. They might be the most generous people I've ever met. Instead of tipping, Luntz's narrator does what most of us do: uses elaborate framing to justify his actions and even makes himself feel good that he’s teaching them a lesson about the truth of that framing. This spotlights our decay.
